# SwapNumbers
Swap Two Numbers in Java
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project demonstrates how to swap two numbers in Java by using a temporary third variable.

It shows:

How to collect numeric input from the user.

How to swap values between two variables.

How to display the values before and after swapping.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
SwapNumbers class:

Contains the main() method.

Prompts the user to enter two numbers.

Swaps the numbers using a third temporary variable (z).

Displays the numbers before and after the swap.

ðŸš€ How It Works
The program asks the user to input two integers (x and y).

It stores the value of x in a temporary variable z.

It assigns the value of y to x, and then the value of z (original x) to y.

It prints the swapped values to the console.

ðŸ›  Example Output
makefile
Copy
Edit
Enter first number (x): 
5
Enter second number (y): 
10

Before swapping:
x = 5
y = 10

After swapping:
x = 10
y = 5
